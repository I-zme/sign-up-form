# sign-up-form

Sign up form for the Odin Project

Required: create a basic form with names, email, password and basic accessability. recognise if possible if the confirm password is equal to the password. use regex.

in this website:
- password validation displayed to user for its different components for better ux
- validation of input displayed for user visually and with aria-label
- password is hidden using * but can be toggled to show the text
- additional instructions for phone available when input is invalid
- regex for all inputs (except email)
- created the logo design personally
- optional entry slider (not in use but can be)


ISSUES:
- use of :has() which is not yet compatible in Firefox, as such form not functional in Firefox (form works but the validation isn't displayed). => will not be addressed
-
